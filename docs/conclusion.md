## Conclusion



## Future Improvements

1. One of the clear changes in data that is not mentioned in previous parts is related to Twitter's change of character limit. Before November 2017, each tweet was limited to 140 characters, and it was expanded to be 280 afterwards. There is clear different in the information content before and after, as illustrated in Figure2 1 and 2. The 20 key-word count as well as positive and negative words count per tweet got noticeably higher after the change. In the future, researchers might want to then add this change as a feature to control for its effect.
